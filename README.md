### What I learned

Right after seeing this project, I knew what I wanted to do with it and what I wanted to add to make it more functional. Although it took me a bit longer than I anticipated, I got the result I desired. I'm not much of a designer, but I tried to make the input panel as close to the original design as possible. The most challenging part of this project was creating a canvas from the generated card and making it downloadable. And thanks to a couple of packages, I managed to accomplish, which seems to be the main goal of the project.

### Useful resources

- [html2canvas](https://html2canvas.hertzen.com/) - This is the package that helped me to generate a canvas from the card.
- [FileSaver.js](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js/) - And with this simple package I was able to add the functionality for the download button.
